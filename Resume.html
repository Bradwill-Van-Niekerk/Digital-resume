            <p>Hey my name is Bradwill Van Niekerk, I am 22 years old currently doing a course in software
                devloment.<br>
                I enjoy gaming and finding out how things work.</p>
            <p>It took me a while but when I found out how enjoyable coding could be I was instintly hooked and I havent
                looked back since, the most exicting and fun part about coding is that there is always new things to
                learn always new ways to go about solving a problem and personally I find that aspect of coding the most
                enjoyable.</p>

            CodeSpace provides an alternative to getting a degree or an accredited qualification.

            CodeSpace is one of many global coding institutions that directly address the skills shortage in the
            tech industry by providing unaccredited, industry-focused training.

            Traditional accreditations have not kept up with the requirements of the tech industry. As a result,
            global tech companies favour candidates with demonstrable development skills, rather than formal
            qualifications. Tech giants like Apple, Google, and IBM, no longer require a degree for a candidate to
            land a job, proving that accreditation no longer equals employability.

        <p>I was a line attendent, therefor i was in charge of making sure the production line was running to
            taget, as
            well as
            find and report any defective or malformed bottles.
            Aside from that I was also required to make sure the line is clean of broken glass, as this could
            potenially
            lead to
            glass contaminating the glass that would be sent to clients.</p><br>
