            <p>Hey my name is Bradwill Van Niekerk, I am 22 years old currently doing a course in software
                devloment.<br>
                I enjoy gaming and finding out how things work.</p>
            <p>It took me a while but when I found out how enjoyable coding could be I was instintly hooked and I havent
                looked back since, the most exicting and fun part about coding is that there is always new things to
                learn always new ways to go about solving a problem and personally I find that aspect of coding the most
                enjoyable.</p>

                CodeSpace provides an alternative to getting a degree or an accredited qualification.

                CodeSpace is one of many global coding institutions that directly address the skills shortage in the
                tech industry by providing unaccredited, industry-focused training.

                Traditional accreditations have not kept up with the requirements of the tech industry. As a result,
                global tech companies favour candidates with demonstrable development skills, rather than formal
                qualifications. Tech giants like Apple, Google, and IBM, no longer require a degree for a candidate to
                land a job, proving that accreditation no longer equals employability.

            <p>I was a line attendent, therefor i was in charge of making sure the production line was running to
                taget, as
                well as
                find and report any defective or malformed bottles.
                Aside from that I was also required to make sure the line is clean of broken glass, as this could
                potenially
                lead to
                glass contaminating the glass that would be sent to clients.</p><br>
